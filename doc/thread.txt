This is memorandam for the points of using multi-thread for this product.

This is only for Linux.
There are two thread methods, standard library thread and POSIX thread.
C++11

to build an application using thread, it needs to add -pthread in the CMakefile as following even using std::thread.
without it, it threw an error while running application.
	find_package(thread)
	target_link_libraries(AppName pthread)

It can be compiled but runtime error because there is weak symbol definition in the libstdc++.
